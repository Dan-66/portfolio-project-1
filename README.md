In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
