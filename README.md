# The FunderDome

The FunderDome is a gamers paradise featuring everything from retro video games to online and local  multi-player video games and even a crazy golf course. This website is targeted at families, gamers and crazy golf enthusiasts of all ages and seeks to create a hub for the local gaming community. This is achieved by showcasing all the games on offer with a simple, uniform and eye-catching design and layout.

## Features

### Existing Features
 *  **Navigation Bar**

    * Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Games section and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

    * This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. These links are highlighted when hovered over creating improved visibility and a visual call to action.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

I opted for a simple layout and easily recognisable and accessible colour palette/scheme that would fit the retro gaming feel of the business.

I have tested all logo, nav bar and footer links and they are working as they should. The sign up form allows the user to submit full name and email address and is prompted if fields not filled or no email address recognised before submission. The checkbox is optional and I used the formdump link to post the entered information to the server for back edn purposes and review.

The website seems responsive on all the sizes stated in the media queries in style.css although there is certainly room for further inprovement and fine tuning. On desktop/laptop screens text and images vary diagonally but on tablets and mobile I opted for a more centered approach to avoid major styling issues and user confusion.

The footer strays from the right hand side of the webpage at 484px wide and would need to be further assessed and resolved.
